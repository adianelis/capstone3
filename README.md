Unsupervised Learning

Steps: 

1- Go out and find a dataset of interest. It could be one that helps you work on one of our recommended research questions, or any other dataset that addresses an unsupervised learning question of your own.

2- Explore the data. Get to know the data. Spend a lot of time going over its quirks and peccadilloes. You should understand how it was gathered, what's in it, and what the variables look like.

3- You should try several different approaches and really work to tune a variety of models before choosing what you consider to be the best performer.
